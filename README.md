# Code Fencing

> A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with the same color. Note that it is possible to color a cycle graph with even cycle using two colors.Refer this site for more info <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bipartite-graph/>

```

int n;
